=head1 Tracing and Debugging Helpers

=head2 Tracing

This package provides simple tracing for debugging and reporting purposes. To use it simply call the
L</TSetup> or L</ETracing> method to set the options and call L</Trace> to write out trace messages.
L</TSetup> and L</ETracing> both establish a I<trace level> and a list of I<categories>. Similarly,
each trace message has a I<trace level> and I<category> associated with it. Only messages whose trace
level is less than or equal to the setup trace level and whose category is activated will
be written. Thus, a higher trace level on a message indicates that the message
is less likely to be seen, while a higher trace level passed to B<TSetup> means more trace messages will
appear.

=head3 Putting Trace Messages in Your Code

To generate a trace message, use the following syntax.

    Trace($message) if T(errors => 4);

This statement will produce a trace message if the trace level is 4 or more and the C<errors>
category is active. There is a special category C<main> that is always active, so

    Trace($message) if T(main => 4);

will trace if the trace level is 4 or more.

If the category name is the same as the package name, all you need is the number. So, if the
following call is made in the B<Sprout> package, it will appear if the C<Sprout> category is
active and the trace level is 2 or more.

    Trace($message) if T(2);

In scripts, where no package name is available, the category defaults to C<main>.

=head3 Custom Tracing

Many programs have customized tracing configured using the L</TSetup> method. This is no longer
the preferred method, but a knowledge of how custom tracing works can make the more modern
L</Emergency Tracing> easier to understand.

To set up custom tracing, you call the L</TSetup> method. The method takes as input a trace level,
a list of category names, and a destination. The trace level and list of category names are
specified as a space-delimited string. Thus

    TSetup('3 errors Sprout ERDB', 'TEXT');

sets the trace level to 3, activates the C<errors>, C<Sprout>, and C<ERDB> categories, and
specifies that messages should be sent to the standard output.

To turn on tracing for ALL categories, use an asterisk. The call below sets every category to
level 3 and writes the output to the standard error output. This sort of thing might be
useful in a CGI environment.

    TSetup('3 *', 'WARN');

In addition standard error and file output for trace messages, you can specify that the trace messages
be queued. The messages can then be retrieved by calling the L</QTrace> method. This approach
is useful if you are building a web page. Instead of having the trace messages interspersed with
the page output, they can be gathered together and displayed at the end of the page. This makes
it easier to debug page formatting problems.

Finally, you can specify that all trace messages be emitted to a file, or the standard output and
a file at the same time. To trace to a file, specify the filename with an output character in front
of it.

    TSetup('4 SQL', ">$fileName");

To trace to the standard output and a file at the same time, put a C<+> in front of the angle
bracket.

    TSetup('3 *', "+>$fileName");

The flexibility of tracing makes it superior to simple use of directives like C<die> and C<warn>.
Tracer calls can be left in the code with minimal overhead and then turned on only when needed.
Thus, debugging information is available and easily retrieved even when the application is
being used out in the field.

=head3 Trace Levels

There is no hard and fast rule on how to use trace levels. The following is therefore only
a suggestion.

=over 4

=item Error 0

Message indicates an error that may lead to incorrect results or that has stopped the
application entirely.

=item Warning 1

Message indicates something that is unexpected but that probably did not interfere
with program execution.

=item Notice 2

Message indicates the beginning or end of a major task.

=item Information 3

Message indicates a subtask. In the FIG system, a subtask generally relates to a single
genome. This would be a big loop that is not expected to execute more than 500 times or so.

=item Detail 4

Message indicates a low-level loop iteration.

=back

The format of trace messages is important because some utilities analyze trace files.
There are three fields-- the time stamp, the category name, and the text.
The time stamp is between square brackets and the category name between angle brackets.
After the category name there is a colon (C<:>) followed by the message text.
If the square brackets or angle brackets are missing, then the trace management
utilities assume that they are encountering a set of pre-formatted lines.

Note, however, that this formatting is done automatically by the tracing functions. You
only need to know about it if you want to parse a trace file.

=head3 Emergency Tracing

Sometimes, you need a way for tracing to happen automatically without putting parameters
in a form or on the command line. Emergency tracing does this. You invoke emergency tracing
from the debug form, which is accessed from the [[DebugConsole]]. Emergency tracing requires
that you specify a tracing key. For command-line tools, the key is
taken from the C<TRACING> environment variable. For web services, the key is taken from
a cookie. Either way, the key tells the tracing facility who you are, so that you control
the tracing in your environment without stepping on other users.

The key can be anything you want. If you don't have a key, the C<SetPassword> page will
generate one for you.

You can activate and de-activate emergency tracing from the debugging control panel, as
well as display the trace file itself.

To enable emergency tracing in your code, call

    ETracing($cgi)

from a web script and

    ETracing()

from a command-line script.

The web script will look for the tracing key in the cookies, and the command-line
script will look for it in the C<TRACING> environment variable. If you are
using the L</StandardSetup> method or a [[WebApplication]], emergency tracing
will be configured automatically.

=head3 Setups

    my $count = Tracer::Setups();

Return the number of times L</TSetup> has been called.

This method allows for the creation of conditional tracing setups where, for example, we
may want to set up tracing if nobody else has done it before us.

This method is used to specify the trace options. The options are stored as package data
and interrogated by the L</Trace> and L</T> methods.

=over 4

=item categoryList

A string specifying the trace level and the categories to be traced, separated by spaces.
The trace level must come first.

=item target

The destination for the trace output. To send the trace output to a file, specify the file
name preceded by a ">" symbol. If a double symbol is used (">>"), then the data is appended
to the file. Otherwise the file is cleared before tracing begins. Precede the first ">"
symbol with a C<+> to echo output to a file AND to the standard output. In addition to
sending the trace messages to a file, you can specify a special destination. C<HTML> will
cause tracing to the standard output with each line formatted as an HTML paragraph. C<TEXT>
will cause tracing to the standard output as ordinary text. C<ERROR> will cause trace
messages to be sent to the standard error output as ordinary text. C<QUEUE> will cause trace
messages to be stored in a queue for later retrieval by the L</QTrace> method. C<WARN> will
cause trace messages to be emitted as warnings using the B<warn> directive.  C<NONE> will
cause tracing to be suppressed.

=head3 ParseDate

    my $time = Tracer::ParseDate($dateString);

Convert a date into a PERL time number. This method expects a date-like string
and parses it into a number. The string must be vaguely date-like or it will
return an undefined value. Our requirement is that a month and day be
present and that three pieces of the date string (time of day, month and day,
year) be separated by likely delimiters, such as spaces, commas, and such-like.

If a time of day is present, it must be in military time with two digits for
everything but the hour.

The year must be exactly four digits.

Additional stuff can be in the string. We presume it's time zones or weekdays or something
equally innocuous. This means, however, that a sufficiently long sentence with date-like
parts in it may be interpreted as a date. Hopefully this will not be a problem.

It should be guaranteed that this method will parse the output of the L</Now> function.

The parameters are as follows.

=over 4

=item dateString

The date string to convert.

=item RETURN

Returns a PERL time, that is, a number of seconds since the epoch, or C<undef> if
the date string is invalid. A valid date string must contain a month and day.

Trace the call stack and abort the program with the specified message. When used with
the OR operator and the L</Assert> method, B<Confess> can function as a debugging assert.
So, for example

    Assert($recNum >= 0) || Confess("Invalid record number $recNum.");

    Warn($message, @options);

This method traces an important message. If an RSS feed is configured
(via I<FIG_Config::error_feed>) and the tracing destination is C<WARN>,
then the message will be echoed to the feed. In general, a tracing
destination of C<WARN> indicates that the caller is running as a web
service in a production environment; however, this is not a requirement.

To force warnings into the RSS feed even when the tracing destination
is not C<WARN>, simply specify the C<Feed> tracing module. This can be
configured automatically when L</StandardSetup> is used.

The L</Cluck> method calls this one for its final message. Since
L</Confess> calls L</Cluck>, this means that any error which is caught
and confessed will put something in the feed. This insures that someone
will be alerted relatively quickly when a failure occurs.

Set up emergency tracing. Emergency tracing is tracing that is turned
on automatically for any program that calls this method. The emergency
tracing parameters are stored in a a file identified by a tracing key.
If this method is called with a CGI object, then the tracing key is
taken from a cookie. If it is called with no parameters, then the tracing
key is taken from an environment variable. If it is called with a string,
the tracing key is that string.

=item parameter

A parameter from which the tracing key is computed. If it is a scalar,
that scalar is used as the tracing key. If it is a CGI object, the
tracing key is taken from the C<IP> cookie. If it is omitted, the
tracing key is taken from the C<TRACING> environment variable. If it
is a CGI object and emergency tracing is not on, the C<Trace> and
C<TF> parameters will be used to determine the type of tracing.

Turn on emergency tracing. This method is normally invoked over the web from

The caller specifies the duration of the emergency in hours, the desired tracing
destination, the trace level, and a list of the trace modules to activate.
For the length of the duration, when a program in an environment with the
specified tracing key active invokes a Sprout CGI script, tracing will be
turned on automatically. See L</TSetup> for more about tracing setup and

=head3 Open

    my $handle = Open($fileHandle, $fileSpec, $message);

Open a file.

The I<$fileSpec> is essentially the second argument of the PERL C<open>
function. The mode is specified using Unix-like shell information. So, for
example,

    Open(\*LOGFILE, '>>/usr/spool/news/twitlog', "Could not open twit log.");

would open for output appended to the specified file, and

    Open(\*DATASTREAM, "| sort -u >$outputFile", "Could not open $outputFile.");

would open a pipe that sorts the records written and removes duplicates. Note
the use of file handle syntax in the Open call. To use anonymous file handles,
code as follows.

    my $logFile = Open(undef, '>>/usr/spool/news/twitlog', "Could not open twit log.");

The I<$message> parameter is used if the open fails. If it is set to C<0>, then
the open returns TRUE if successful and FALSE if an error occurred. Otherwise, a
failed open will throw an exception and the third parameter will be used to construct
an error message. If the parameter is omitted, a standard message is constructed
using the file spec.

    Could not open "/usr/spool/news/twitlog"

Note that the mode characters are automatically cleaned from the file name.
The actual error message from the file system will be captured and appended to the
message in any case.

    Could not open "/usr/spool/news/twitlog": file not found.

In some versions of PERL the only error message we get is a number, which
corresponds to the C++ C<errno> value.

    Could not open "/usr/spool/news/twitlog": 6.

=over 4

=item fileHandle

File handle. If this parameter is C<undef>, a file handle will be generated
and returned as the value of this method.

=item fileSpec

File name and mode, as per the PERL C<open> function.

=item message (optional)

Error message to use if the open fails. If omitted, a standard error message
will be generated. In either case, the error information from the file system
is appended to the message. To specify a conditional open that does not throw
an error if it fails, use C<0>.

=item RETURN

Returns the name of the file handle assigned to the file, or C<undef> if the
open failed.

=back

=cut

sub Open {
    # Get the parameters.

}

=head3 FindNamePart

    my ($fileName, $start, $len) = Tracer::FindNamePart($fileSpec);

Extract the portion of a file specification that contains the file name.

A file specification is the string passed to an C<open> call. It specifies the file
mode and name. In a truly complex situation, it can specify a pipe sequence. This
method assumes that the file name is whatever follows the first angle bracket
sequence.  So, for example, in the following strings the file name is
C</usr/fig/myfile.txt>.

    >>/usr/fig/myfile.txt
    </usr/fig/myfile.txt
    | sort -u > /usr/fig/myfile.txt

If the method cannot find a file name using its normal methods, it will return the
whole incoming string.

=over 4

=item fileSpec

File specification string from which the file name is to be extracted.

=item RETURN

Returns a three-element list. The first element contains the file name portion of
the specified string, or the whole string if a file name cannot be found via normal
methods. The second element contains the start position of the file name portion and
the third element contains the length.

=head3 OpenDir

    my @files = OpenDir($dirName, $filtered, $flag);

Open a directory and return all the file names. This function essentially performs
the functions of an C<opendir> and C<readdir>. If the I<$filtered> parameter is
set to TRUE, all filenames beginning with a period (C<.>), dollar sign (C<$>),
or pound sign (C<#>) and all filenames ending with a tilde C<~>) will be
filtered out of the return list. If the directory does not open and I<$flag> is not
set, an exception is thrown. So, for example,

    my @files = OpenDir("/Volumes/fig/contigs", 1);

is effectively the same as

    opendir(TMP, "/Volumes/fig/contigs") || Confess("Could not open /Volumes/fig/contigs.");
    my @files = grep { $_ !~ /^[\.\$\#]/ && $_ !~ /~$/ } readdir(TMP);

Similarly, the following code

    my @files = grep { $_ =~ /^\d/ } OpenDir("/Volumes/fig/orgs", 0, 1);

Returns the names of all files in C</Volumes/fig/orgs> that begin with digits and
automatically returns an empty list if the directory fails to open.

Name of the directory to open.

Set the permissions for a directory and all the files and folders inside it.
In addition, the group ownership will be changed to the specified value.

This method is more vulnerable than most to permission and compatability
problems, so it does internal error recovery.

=over 4

=item dirName

Name of the directory to process.

=item group

Name of the group to be assigned.

=item mask

Permission mask. Bits that are C<1> in this mask will be ORed into the
permission bits of any file or directory that does not already have them
set to 1.

=item otherMasks

Map of search patterns to permission masks. If a directory name matches
one of the patterns, that directory and all its members and subdirectories
will be assigned the new pattern. For example, the following would
assign 0664 to most files, but would use 0777 for directories named C<tmp>.

    Tracer::SetPermissions($dirName, 'fig', 01664, '^tmp$' => 01777);

The list is ordered, so the following would use 0777 for C<tmp1> and
0666 for C<tmp>, C<tmp2>, or C<tmp3>.

    Tracer::SetPermissions($dirName, 'fig', 01664, '^tmp1' => 0777,
                                                   '^tmp' => 0666);

Note that the pattern matches are all case-insensitive, and only directory
names are matched, not file names.

parts are compared numerically. A stream of just numbers or a stream of
just strings will sort correctly, and a mixed stream will sort with the
numbers first. Strings with a label and a number will sort in the
expected manner instead of lexically. Undefined values sort last.

Reference to the hash that is to be interrogated or updated.

=item name

Name of the field. This is the hash key.
