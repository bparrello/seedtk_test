This script analyzes relationships in a Shrub database and deletes instances that
link to entities that do not exist.

The positional parameters are the relationship names.

The command-line options are those described in L<Shrub/new_for_script> plus the
following.

=over 4

=item all

Process all relationships. If this option is specified, no relationship names should be
specified on the command line.
