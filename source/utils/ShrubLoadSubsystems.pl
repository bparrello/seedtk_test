=head1 Load Subsystems Into the Shrub Database

    ShrubLoadSubsystems.pl [options] subsysDirectory

This script loads subsystems, related proteins, and their assignments into the Shrub database. The protein assignments
are taken from subsystems to insure they are of the highest quality. This process is used to prime
the database with priority assignments, and also to periodically update assignments.

This script performs three separate tasks-- loading the subsystem descriptors and the associated roles,
assigning functions to proteins, and connecting subsystems to genomes. Any or all of these functions can
be performed. The default is to do nothing (which is pretty useless). If you specify the C<all> command-line
option, all three functions will be performed. Otherwise, the individual functions can be turned on by
specifying the appropriate option (C<subs>, C<links>, and/or C<prots>).

=head2 Parameters

The positional parameter is the name of the directory containing the subsystem source
directory. If omitted, it will be computed from information in the L<FIG_Config> module.

The command-line options are as specified in L<Shrub/new_for_script> plus
the following.

=over 4

=item privilege

Privilege level (0, 1, or 2). The function assignments will be added at the specified privilege
level and all levels below it and the subsystems are given the specified privilege level. The default
is C<0>, indicating unprivileged subsystems and assignments.

=item subsystems

If specified, the name of a file containing subsystem names. Only the named subsystems
will be loaded. Otherwise, all the subsystems in the directory will be loaded.

=item missing

If specified, only missing subsystems will be loaded.

=item clear

If specified, the subsystem tables will be cleared prior to loading. If this is the case, C<missing>
will have no effect.

=item links

If specified, the subsystem-to-genome links will be filled in.

=item prots

If specified, the proteins and function assignments will be filled in.

=item roles

If specified, the subsystems and roles will be filled in.

=item slow

If specified, each table record will be inserted individually. Otherwise, new records will be spooled to a
flat file and uploaded at the end of the run.

=item all

Implies C<links>, C<prots>, and C<roles>.

=item genomeDir

Directory containing the genome source files. If not specified, the default will be
computed from information in the L<FIG_Config> file.
