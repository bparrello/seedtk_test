=head1 Shrub Database Package

=head2 Introduction

The Shrub database is a new Entity-Relationship Database that implements
the repository for the SEEDtk system. This object has minimal
capabilities: most of its power comes the L<ERDB> base class.

The fields in this object are as follows.

=over 4

=item loadDirectory

Name of the directory containing the files used by the loaders.

=item repository

Name of the directory containing the genome repository.

=back

=head3 Global Section Constant

Each section of the database used by the loader corresponds to a single genome.
The global section is loaded after all the others, and is concerned with data
not related to a particular genome.

=cut

    # Name of the global section
    use constant GLOBAL => 'Globals';
    
=head3 new

    my $shrub = Shrub->new(%options);

Construct a new Shrub object. The following options are supported.

=over 4

=item loadDirectory

Data directory to be used by the loaders.

=item DBD

XML database definition file.

=item dbName

Name of the database to use.

=item sock

Socket for accessing the database.

=item userData

Name and password used to log on to the database, separated by a slash.

=item dbhost

Database host name.

=item port

MYSQL port number to use (MySQL only).

=item dbms

Database management system to use (e.g. C<SQLite> or C<postgres>, default C<mysql>).

=item repository

Name of the directory containing the genome repository.

=item offline

If TRUE, then the database object will be built, but there will be no
connection made to the database. The default is FALSE.

=item externalDBD

If TRUE, then the external database definition (DBD) XML file will override whatever is stored
in the database. This is implied if B<DBD> is specified.

=head3 new_for_script

    my ($shrub, $opt, $usage) = Shrub->new_for_script($program, \%tuning, @options);

Construct a new Shrub object for a command-line script. This method
uses a call to L<GetOpt::Long::Descriptive/describe_options> to parse the command-line
options, passing in the incoming B<program> and B<options> parameters.

If the command-line parse fails, the method will die with a usage message.

For example

	my ($shrub, $opt, $usage) = Shrub->new_for_script('%c %o genome1 genome2 ...', 
			{ offline => 1},
			[ 'missing|m', "only load missing genomes"],
			[ 'directory|d=s', "source directory", { default => '/vol/fig/shrub_data' }]);

will create an offline L<Shrub> object. The C<$opt> object will have a member
C<missing> that is TRUE if we should only load missing genomes and a member
C<directory> that returns the source directory. The C<text> member of C<$usage> can
be used to display a usage string in error messages, and if the user invokes the
C<--help> option on the command line, all of the option information will be displayed
in full detail. 

The following command-line options (all of which are optional) will
be processed by this method automatically and used to construct the Shrub object.
